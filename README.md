### Hi there 👋
UX Design 🗣️ Digital Education ✏️ Illustration 🎨

A UX designer with an affinity for research and excitement for building products that excite people. Loves to work on diverse, agile teams to build apps and other digital experiences from conception to deployment.
Came to UX after honing my research and presentation skills by teaching digital media art to middle schoolers and–before that—fact-checking social media videos. In school I specialized in printmaking and comics, giving me an eye for page layout and a skilled hand for drafting.

My goal is to put my impulse toward playful design and my experience designing curricula to the task of improving the user experience of digital learning platforms.
